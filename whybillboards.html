        <h2>Why Billboards?</h2>
        <span>Credibility and Repetition</span>

      <p>
        In a competitive and rapidly changing world and marketplace, billboards are there day
        in and day out. Viewers can’t change the channel, opt out, unsubscribe, or throw it
        away. Additionally, they don’t require active participation to be viewed; no need to
        click, turn the page, or buy a subscription. They are just out there, and for most
        viewers day after day after day.

        Locally the Inland Empire (composed of San Bernardino and Riverside Counties and also
        referred to the Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario CBSA) is a culture of drivers because
        it is so big (over 27,000 sq.mi.) but has very limited public transportation options.
        Statistically over 90% of Inland Empire residents drive to work, and over 45% of them
        commute an hour or more each day.
